This dataset was provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization.

NLP:
This dataset offers a supreme environment to parse out the reviews text through its multiple dimensions.
Clustering:
Some customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad?
Feature Engineering:
